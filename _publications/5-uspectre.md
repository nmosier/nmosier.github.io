title: "Analyzing and Exploiting Branch Mispredictions in Microcode"
collection: publications
excerpt: "We present µSpectre, a new class of transient execution attacks that exploit microcode branch mispredictions to transiently leak sensitive data. We find that many long-known and recently-discovered transient execution attacks, which were previously categorized as Spectre or Meltdown variants, are actually instances of µSpectre on some Intel microarchitectures. Based on our observations, we discover multiple new µSpectre attacks and present a defense against µSpectre vulnerabilities, called µSLH."

We present µSpectre, a new class of transient execution attacks that exploit microcode branch mispredictions to transiently leak sensitive data. We find that many long-known and recently-discovered transient execution attacks, which were previously categorized as Spectre or Meltdown variants, are actually instances of µSpectre on some Intel microarchitectures. Based on our observations, we discover multiple new µSpectre attacks and present a defense against µSpectre vulnerabilities, called µSLH.
