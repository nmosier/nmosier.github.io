excerpt: "Integer factorization is an inherently diﬃcult problem for which there is no known algorithm that produces an answer in polynomial time. Until recently, it was unknown whether the very similar but weaker problem of primality testing is equally diﬃcult. Primality testing is the problem of determining whether an arbitrary positive integer n ∈N is prime or composite. In 2002, Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena presented a provably correct deterministic primality test that terminates in polynomial time over all N. Although previous polynomial-time algorithms had been presented, they rely upon unproven claims such as the Riemann Hypothesis. We restrict our focus to algorithms that are unconditionally correct. In this paper, we review principles common to existing deterministic, polynomial-time primality tests, specifically Fermat’s Little Theorem (FlT) and the related topic of cyclotomic fields. We introduce a simple primality test based on FlT, and then discuss increasingly advanced algorithms (Pocklington primality test, APR primality test). In the second part of the paper, we prove the correctness of the AKS Primality Test, concluding that primality testing is a problem solvable in polynomial time."
