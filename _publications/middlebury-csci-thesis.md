excerpt: "Spectre, a class of speculative execution vulnerabilities disclosed in 2018, has demonstrated weaknesses in existing security protections. Attackers can exploit speculative buﬀer overflows, a Spectre variant, to achieve arbitrary speculative code execution in victims. The security community has not thoroughly explored which security protections speculative buﬀer overflows can bypass. Previous literature assesses that address space layout randomization (ASLR), a security protection in modern operating systems, eﬀectively mitigates speculative buﬀer overflow attacks. I present SpectreR2P, a host-based attack that discloses a victim’s ASLR-randomized code address via speculative buﬀer overflow, thereby demonstrating the ineﬀectiveness of ASLR against speculative buﬀer overflows."
